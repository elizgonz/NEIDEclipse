# Shadowing the Sun I: Testing Synthetic Granulation Spectra with NEID Solar Eclipse Observations (Gonzalez et al. 2026)

GRASS (GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator) is a Julia package designed to produce time series of stellar spectra with realistic line-shape changes from solar granulation. GRASS v1.0.x is described in detail in [Palumbo et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11839) and GRASS v2.0.x is presented in [Palumbo et al. (2024a)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07945).

GRASS-E repurposes the GRASS software to produce granulation-driven solar spectra during a solar eclipse. GRASS-E is presented and validated against the 2023 October 14 solar eclipse in Gonzalez et al. 2026. This repository provides the scripts and required information to generate the models (via GPU) from Gonzalez et al. 2026. 

## Installation

GRASS is written entirely in Julia and requires Julia v1.9 or greater. Installation instructions for Julia are available from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

GRASS itself only requires a few steps to install. Simply clone the repo to your desired directory...

```bash
git clone git@github.com:palumbom/GRASS.git
cd GRASS 
julia
```

... and then add it with Julia's built-in package manager, `Pkg`:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(path=".") # assuming you are in /PATH/TO/GRASS
using GRASS
```

If you wish to develop or otherwise contribute to GRASS, instead add the package in develop mode:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.develop(path=".") # assuming you are in /PATH/TO/GRASS
using GRASS
```

Upon first invocation of GRASS, Julia will automatically install the package dependencies and download the required input data. The input data can be re-installed by invoking

```julia
Pkg.build("GRASS")
```

## Basic GRASS-E CPU Example

```julia
using GRASS
using PyPlot
using DataFrames
using CSV

#NEID solar feed coordinates
obs_lat = 31.9583 
obs_long = -111.5967  
alt = 2.097938

# parameters for lines in the spectra
lines = [5434.5232]                 # array of line centers 
templates = ["FeI_5434"]            # template data to use
depths = [0.6]                      # array of line depths
variability = trues(length(lines))  # granulation signature toggle 
blueshifts = zeros(length(lines))   # set convective blueshift value
resolution = 7e5                    # spectral resolution
spec = GRASS.SpecParams(lines=lines, depths=depths, variability=variability, blueshifts=blueshifts, templates=templates, resolution=resolution) 

# read in NEID timestamps for October solar eclipse 
df = CSV.read("data/NEIDOctoberTimestamps.csv", DataFrame)
# specify number of epochs 
disk = GRASS.Eclipse.DiskParamsEclipse(Nt=length(df.UTC))

# specify limb darkening law to use
LD_type = "SSD_4parameter"
# specify optimized wavelength-dependent extinction coefficent  
ext_coeff = 0.15452995224327976

# synthesize the spectra
wavelengths, flux = GRASS.Eclipse.synthesize_spectra_eclipse(spec, disk, lines, LD_type, obs_long, obs_lat, alt, string.(df.UTC), ext_coeff, ext_toggle=true, use_gpu=false)
# compute radial velocities
wavs_sim, flux_sim = GRASS.convolve_gauss(wavelengths, flux, new_res=11e4)
v_grid_cpu, ccf_cpu = GRASS.calc_ccf(wavs_sim, flux_sim, lines, depths, 11e4)
rv_cpu, rv_error = GRASS.calc_rvs_from_ccf(v_grid_cpu, ccf_cpu)
```
